Ever since I was little, I've been interested in technology. It all started when I got my first gaming console Nintendo 64 in 1997 and since then I've been a big fan of games. Shortly thereafter I got my first PC, a humble thing running Windows 95. 

Over the years I spent more and more time in front of the computer and finally found a new creative passion in programming. Back in the day, when you bought a computer magazine you got a little CD with demo programs as well as the newest version of DirectX. This was how I got updates because we didn't have internett access.

One of these CDs contained a version of Visual Studio. I did'nt know what it was but sure enough I installed it and soon found myself creating small snippets of code which hardly did anything but I remember it was an empowering feeling to have the freedom over what happened on the computer.

After a while I began experimenting with visual basic and created simple games like three in a row, simple platform jumping games and then the last thing I created was a 2D gravity simulation using real physics formulas. At that point I was studying physics in high school and knew what I wanted to pursue, namely programming, well, with hopes of creating games.

I got into University of Oslo in 2011, took as many programming courses as I could and afterwords began working in Sportradar, a world leading company that delivers sport data and odds to its clients.
